# Active Context: Current Development Status

## Current Work Focus
- Implementation phase completed successfully
- Memory bank consolidation and reflection
- Documentation of learnings and achievements

## Recent Changes
- Fixed CORS issues with dual-mode API service
- Implemented comprehensive mock data system
- Created robust error handling with automatic fallbacks
- Built complete glassmorphic UI with all features
- Added memory bank reflection and consolidation
- Updated all documentation with final learnings

## Next Steps
1. Production deployment with CORS resolution
2. Real API integration when CORS is resolved
3. Additional features (user accounts, search, etc.)
4. Performance optimization for production
5. Continuous improvement based on user feedback

## Active Decisions
- Using biblia-api.vercel.app for Spanish Reina-Valera 1960
- Dual-mode API service (mock for dev, real for production)
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback strategy
- Glassmorphic UI with responsive design
- Next.js App Router with proper state management

## Important Patterns
- Dual-mode API service pattern
- Automatic fallback error handling
- Comprehensive mock data architecture
- Glassmorphic component system
- CORS resolution strategies
- Performance caching patterns

## Learnings
